**Fuze box lesson 2**

Today me and my partner made a lot of progress with the fuze box completing the task set and then advancing on to the extension.

 Things that went well are how well me and my partner worked 

together which is why we got so much done.

However if I had to do this lesson again there are a few things that I would change. The first thing would be to be more careful as there were a few times me and my partner didn't read the instructions quite right and therefore had to restart the whole thing which was very very annoying.

Next lesson to improve on this I will make sure I am careful whilst reading the instructions to make sure I don't mess up and have to restart. I will make sure I do this by checking over my work and comparing it to the instructions before I submit it.
