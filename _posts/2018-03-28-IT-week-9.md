IT week 9

Today we continued in our topic of python and learnt some more advanced coding and more advanced stuff of what we can do with Python.

If I had to improve something about this lesson I would probbaly make sure that I keep my focous and make sure that I am fully focoused on the task at hand and do not get distracted as that happened a few times today.

Overall though I feel again I did well this lesson as I managed to get the work done with a little bit of help from Mr. Keen and my partner where we made sure to help each other when we needed it.

I hope that it will be the same next IT lesson.
