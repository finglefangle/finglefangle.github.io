**Fuze box lesson 6**

Today me and my partner got to try out the robot arm which is connected to the fuze box. This was really cool as it can do stuff like pick up pencils rubbers and lots of stuff it can also hold onto different body parts like your nose, your finger and even your toe. It was quite easy to code as we had the booklet which told us what to do and we managed to get it to do quite a lot of the things i just mentioned like pick up my nose which was the funniest thing out of all them.

Not much could improve from this lesson as me and my partner worked well so I hope next lesson will be like this one as we managed to get a lot of work done all of which was very entertaining to do.
