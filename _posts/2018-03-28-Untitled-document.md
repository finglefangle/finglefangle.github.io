IT week 11

Our aim in this lesson was to do some more code academy and continue on our progress from the last week and homework.

I believe that this was not my best lesson as I did get a bit distracted and didn't work to my max capability. This meant that didn't get as much stuff done that I  could've. I believe that if I went back in time to that lesson that I could’ve and definitely would’ve got a lot more stuff done then I originally did as most of my time was spent talking to my partner next to me and not really focusing. 

To improve the next time I will make sure that all my concentration goes too what we are working on in that lesson. I will also definitely make sure that if we are doing codecademy again that I won't just click the give me the solution buttons and have a proper go at the problems before i result to that solution.
