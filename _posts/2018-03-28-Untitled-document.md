IT week 12

Today I was off sick and therefore missed out on the IT lesson. To make sure I catch up I will go and see one of my friends or someone in my class and ask them if we got any homework and if what we did in class. This will allow me to do the classwork and make sure I am up to date with everything and also make sure that I won't miss any homework.
