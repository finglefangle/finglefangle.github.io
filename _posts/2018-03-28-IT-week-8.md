IT week 8

Today we started our work on python which will be our new topic for the whole of this term. We learnt the basics of Python and some very minor things of what you can do with the many options Python can show you.

I think I did well this lesson as I managed to get my basic code to work pretty easily and I also helped my partner who was struggling and managed to get his to work for him. Which made me feel good about myself as last term I struggeled abit with IT and didnt really know what to do or how to do it.
