Fuze box lesson 4

Today me and my partner finished the booklet on fuze box which means now we can create our very own avatars. This will be hard though and we will be doing it after half term. Me and my partner worked really well today and we completed what our aim for this lesson was last week which was too share the workload more between us. I think i'll hope for after half term will be to work exactly how we worked today as this was the week we got the most work done.

I will make sure we will complete this by doing everything that I said to do last lesson which was to talk before the lesson about which work we will do because that proved extremely effective.
