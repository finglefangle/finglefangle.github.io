**Fuse**

In today's lesson we learnt how to use a fuse box. At the start of the lesson me and my partner got a bit stuck and didn't know what to do. However as the lesson went on we started to figure it out and managed to get past stage 1.

The thing that held me back in this lesson was giving up when we couldn't do it and not trying hard enough so next time I will try not to let this happen and just get on with it and if worst comes to worst ask for help from a teacher.

Next lesson I will attempt to get more work done now that I know what i'm doing. Also I will help my partner a it more as he did moe work last lesson when we got stuck.
