IT week 10

Today in IT we continued our progress in code academy which we have been doing every other lesson. I started the lesson on a progress of 28% and then finished on 34% . As the lesson went on and the code became increased harder I did get a bit frustrated.

So next lesson I will try not to get so frustrated and not just click the 'give me the solution' button as that is cheating. The way I will do this is by asking my partner or someone around me for help and try the question until I am absolutely sure that there is nothing else that I could do and I have tried as much as I possibly can.

For my homework I managed to get up to 40% and completed some really hard coding questions which made me feel really good about myself as I struggled until the end of the lesson and got frustrated. However at home I really got it and managed to complete a whole section with 14 questions of code academy,
