Fuze box lesson 3

Today me and my partner worked really well together and we got all the assessments done. This means that now we will be able to go onto more advance stuff next lesson. The things that could've gone better this lesson is the work load could be more even as some of the time either me or my partner will end up doing more work. We will achieve this by agreeing to how much work we are going to do before the lesson meaning that we will not get into any arguments during the lesson. Overall the lesson was good though.
