First lesson    Date:06/09/17

Today in this lesson we deleted our old blog and started a new one here is how the lesson went:

What went well?

I successfully managed to get my new blog up and running without doing anything wrong so that was a success. I hope to continue this success next week and I will hopefully not have any problems.

What went wrong?

Not much went wrong this lesson however it is inevitable that in the latter weeks of the term I will definitely do something wrong. Now I just have to make sure I stay focused and don't distracted and things will be fine.

What will i do to improve my learning?

I will try and do exactly what I did this week as I thought I did really well this week.
