**Fuze box lesson 5**

Today me and my partner started making avatars which we would then code onto the fuze box. I made a Manchester united symbol as that is the club I support it didn't work though as me and my partner ran out of time and didn't manage to complete the code.

Stuff that i could improve on is trying to code it quicker as then we would not run out of time and we would've managed to complete this. Some of this came from not concentrating one hundred percent throughout the lesson. I will make sure to improve on this next lesson as that will mean me and my partner will make maximum progress and be able to get onto the next task that the teacher sets.
